# Releasing narwhal

This document describes the release procedure for narwhal.
The binary crate is published under **`narwhal`** on crates.io;
the installed binary is `narwhal`.

## 0. Preflight

These must all pass on the candidate commit before any tag is moved:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps
cargo test --workspace
cargo deny check    # advisories, licences, banned crates, sources
```

The CI workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` enforces the same set
on every push; this list is what to run locally before pushing the
release commit.

## 1. Cut the version

- Bump `workspace.package.version` in the root `Cargo.toml`.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` — add a new `## [x.y.z] — YYYY-MM-DD` block,
  move the `[Unreleased]` body into it, leave an empty `[Unreleased]`
  scaffold behind for the next cycle.
- Update version badges in `README.md`.
- Keep `flake.nix` and `docs/RELEASING.md`'s example commands in sync
  with the new tag.

## 2. Commit and tag

```sh
git commit -am "chore: release v1.1.0"
git tag -s v1.1.0 -m "v1.1.0"
```

## 3. Publish to crates.io (in dependency order)

```sh
cargo publish -p narwhal-core
cargo publish -p narwhal-config
cargo publish -p narwhal-sql
cargo publish -p narwhal-pool
cargo publish -p narwhal-history
cargo publish -p narwhal-driver-postgres
cargo publish -p narwhal-driver-mysql
cargo publish -p narwhal-driver-sqlite
cargo publish -p narwhal-driver-duckdb
cargo publish -p narwhal-driver-clickhouse
cargo publish -p narwhal-plugin
cargo publish -p narwhal-plugin-lua
cargo publish -p narwhal-vim
cargo publish -p narwhal-tui
cargo publish -p narwhal-app
# `narwhal-mcp` depends on -core, -config, -history and every driver,
# so it must publish *after* all of them but *before* the bin.
cargo publish -p narwhal-mcp
cargo publish -p narwhal
```

## 4. Build release artifacts

```sh
cargo build --release --bin narwhal
```

- Tar artifacts per platform.
- Sign with cosign or GPG.

## 5. Push the tag

```sh
git push origin v1.1.0
```

## 6. Update packaging templates

- Bump `pkgver` in `packaging/aur/PKGBUILD`.
- Bump `url` + `sha256` in `packaging/homebrew/narwhal.rb`.
- Open PRs / AUR submissions.
