//! Modal-overlay state.
//!
//! Every modal in narwhal (wizard, help overlay, history search,
//! snippets picker) is mutually exclusive with the others *for
//! input-routing purposes* — at most one modal owns keypresses at a
//! time, and `core::run_loop::handle_key` walks them in priority
//! order. Bundling them in a single sub-state makes the precedence
//! check explicit and enforces a single source of truth: every
//! modal-related field is here, nowhere else.
//!
//! Other sub-states (UI, session, process) hold zero modal fields by
//! convention. If a future feature needs cross-modal state, add it
//! here rather than scattering it back into `AppCore`.
