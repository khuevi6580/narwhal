//! Process-lifecycle and async-bridge state.
//!
//! This sub-state owns the moving parts of the event loop: the
//! shutdown flag, the in-flight run/refresh tracking, and the
//! channels that ferry background results back to the UI thread.
//! Bundled together so the lifecycle invariants are obvious in one
//! place:
//!
//! - `should_quit` is set by the global Esc/Ctrl-C handler and read
//!   by the top-level `run` loop. Nothing else writes it.
//! - `running` is true while a query batch is in flight. The status
//!   bar reads it to render the spinner; cancel logic sets the
//!   slot at `cancel_slot` and the worker honours it.
//! - `run_tx` / `meta_tx` are the *sender* halves of the two
//!   channels the UI hands to background tasks. The matching
//!   receivers stay on the event loop because draining them needs
//!   mutable access to `AppCore`. (Receivers therefore live next to
//!   `ProcessState` in `AppCore`, not inside it.)
//! - `refresh_task` is the abort-handle for the current debounced
//!   schema-refresh timer; replaced on each scheduling call.
