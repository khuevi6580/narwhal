//! Connection-and-data-side state.
//!
//! This sub-state owns the durable, user-facing data the app
//! manipulates: the active session, the saved connection catalogue,
//! the recency cache that drives sidebar ordering, the history
//! journal, the snippet store, and the audit gate.
//!
//! It deliberately excludes:
//! - UI-facing state (tabs, focus, theme — see `UiState`)
//! - Modal overlays (wizard, history modal — see `ModalState`)
//! - Lifecycle / channel plumbing (see `ProcessState`)
//! - Immutable services (registry, plugins, credentials — see `AppDeps`)
//!
//! The `pending_session_opens` set lives here because it tracks
//! which session-id values an `OpenSession` reply is allowed to
//! match against; that is fundamentally session-routing state, not
//! lifecycle state.
