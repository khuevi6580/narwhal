//! Shared immutable services.
//!
//! Everything wired in once at startup and read (or mutated through
//! interior `Arc<Mutex<…>>` handles) for the lifetime of the
//! application. Bundling these in one struct makes the dependency
//! surface obvious: a test fixture only has to construct an
//! `AppDeps` to mock the entire I/O boundary.
//!
//! The keymap lives here too because callers borrow it immutably on
//! the hot path; the rare mutation (settings reload) goes through
//! `AppCore::apply_settings` which already takes `&mut self`.
