//! Statement-level splitting of SQL source text.
//!
//! The splitter is dialect-aware so that dialect-specific constructs such
//! as `PostgreSQL` dollar-quoted strings are not mistakenly cut in half.
//! It does not parse SQL; it only locates statement boundaries, which is
//! sufficient for routing each statement to the database driver
//! individually.
